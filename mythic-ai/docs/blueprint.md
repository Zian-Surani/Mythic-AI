# **App Name**: MythiCode AI

## Core Features:

- Symbol Classifier: Image classifier tool to identify magical symbols (tarot cards, runes) based on user uploaded image using a pre-trained CNN model.
- Image Upload: User interface element to upload an image for classification, with drag-and-drop functionality.
- Classification Display: Display the classification results, showing the predicted symbol label and confidence level. Provide a link to learn more about the detected symbol.
- Illusion Generator: Generate an optical illusion using a pre-trained GAN model.  Each time the function is triggered it calls the tool for a newly generated image.
- Illusion Generation Button: A button to trigger the generation of a new optical illusion, complete with a loading spinner animation while the image is being generated.
- Hidden Symbol Detector: Image analyzer tool to detect hidden symbols in user-uploaded artwork images/PDFs. It will highlight or list detected symbols.
- Artwork Upload: Functionality to upload artwork (image/PDF) for hidden symbol detection.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Purple (#8E44AD), inspired by the magical and mysterious theme of the application. The color symbolizes creativity and wisdom.
- Background color: Dark gradient from #1D1D1D to #330052, to evoke a sense of depth and mystery, in alignment with the gradient from #1a1a1a to #2c003e requested in the prompt. 
- Accent color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF), an analogous hue offering vibrancy and contrast, drawing the eye to key interactive elements.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text. Its modern, slightly techy appearance will suit the AI focus, and its readability in headlines and small chunks of body text make it appropriate for an MVP without long-form readability concerns. 
- Use magical and slightly abstract icons to represent the app's features (classification, generation, and detection).
- Page transitions: Fade-in and slide effects to create a smooth and engaging user experience as users navigate through different sections of the application, consistent with the user request to have those animation elements in the UI.
- Button interaction: Subtle glow and lift effects on hover, combined with ripple or scale-in effects on click, to provide clear visual feedback and enhance the interactive feel of the user interface. Consistent with the request from the prompt to add those button design elements.
